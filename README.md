## What is this?

gulp-demo is a bunch of files used to teach gulp! If you stumbled here by accident, feel
free to use this project to teach a lesson or, better yet, fork this repo to make your
own derivative lessons.

## Who is this for?

This was originally written for a "Lunch and Learn" at Technossus; if you're here from
that lunch, welcome!

## How do I use gulp-demo?

Just follow along with the README.md files in each directory.  Start with the first
lesson and make your way through to the end.
